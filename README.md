# Notes

## Background

Notes is based on the Cornell Note Taking system devised by Prof. Walter Pauk 
of Cornell University in 1950.  The notes system has 2 columns divded 
proportionatly vertically down the page, as well as a small section at the bottom
of the page.  In the left hand column key work and questions are list related 
to the topic.  In the right hand side note are taken as per the user preference.
The small section at the bottom is an optional section for a summary of the 
notes.  The image below shows a sketch of the of the Cornell Note Taking system.

## Desctiption

To make the Cornell Note Taking system more efficient, the notes.rb terminal
application has been create.  The aim is to allow the user to input data 
directly into a CLI terminal to be stored for future study and review.

Some modifications are required from the original Cornell Notes:

1. The summary will not be included in notes.rb. This is due to its optionality 
of use and neccessity.

2. The left hand column will primarly focuses on questions instead of key words.
Based on previous use, this has been the most important feature when reviewing
study notes.

3. The questions are specifically related to the coresponing note. This allows 
for quizzing functionality when reviewing the notes.


## Target Audience

notes.rb is primarily focused on the students or academics who are required to
quickly take notes and require a quick method of review later.  notes.rb is
designed to not required the use of paper, therefore not requiring
pages to be drawn up before hand, saving time and space.  The quiz 
function allows for the user to self-assess before an important event.

Users may also find it useful to take notes of a non academic nature such as 
important dates or events. notes.rb will allow this
